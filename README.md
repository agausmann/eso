Random esoteric languages which I decide are funny enough to implement.

- [PUBERTY](https://esolangs.org/wiki/PUBERTY) - `cargo run puberty SCRIPT-FILE`

## Goals

- Zero dependencies (besides `std`) - I write everything myself.

- To finish more small, (usually) easy projects.

- Over all else, have fun!
